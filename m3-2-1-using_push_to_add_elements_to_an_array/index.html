    PROBLEM 2: Create an array called numbers with the elements 1, 2, and 3.

    PROBLEM 3: Create an array called students with the elements "Alice" and "Bob".
    Use the push method to add the string "Charlie" to the end of the array, and
    then use unshift to add the string "David" to the beginning of the array.
    Print the updated array to the console.

    PROBLEM 4: Use the push method to combine arr1 and arr2 into a single array
    and store it in a new variable called combinedArr.
    */
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING): The code below should console.log the array
    ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "grapes", "watermelon"].
    Fix the error and run the corrected code.

    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    Create an object called student with properties for name, age, and grade. Use dot notation to access the name property and store it in a variable called studentName.
    Use square bracket notation to access the age property and store it in a variable called studentAge.
    Finally, log the grade property using either dot or square bracket notation.
    */
    //ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
    let student = { name:"jason mamo", age: 20, grade: 7}
    let studentName = student.name

    console.log(studentage)

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Create an object called car with properties for make, model, year, and color.
    Use dot notation to access the make and model properties and concatenate them together with a space in between. Store the result in a variable called carMakeModel.
    Use square bracket notation to access the year property and store it in a variable called carYear.
    Finally, log the color property using either dot or square bracket notation.

    /*
   PROBLEM 3:
   With the code below, use dot notation to log the title and author properties of the book object.
   Then, use square bracket notation to log the name of the protagonist.
   Finally, use dot notation to log the occupation of the protagonist in the characters array.

    /*
    PROBLEM 4:
    Using the code below, Use square bracket notation to access the math grade and store it in a variable called aliceMathGrade.
    Then, use dot notation to access the name and history grade for the student and concatenate them together with a space in between. Store the result in a variable called aliceNameAndHistoryGrade.
